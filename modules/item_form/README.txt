This module creates a very simple form as a panel pane.

Form at the moment does not do anything, e.g if you click Send Money nothing really happens. 

It's created as an example, but will be used in the near future.

To get everything working;

1. Enable all dependencies,
2. Enable page_manager module

3. Go to admin/structure/pages/add create a custom page and ad Item forms pane to your page.

Go to any node/%nid/edit to see some Drupal Javascript Functionality
